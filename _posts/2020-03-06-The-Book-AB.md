> Suppose you encounter a large sum of factorials and binomial coefficients and whatnot. You would like to know whether or not that sum can be expressed in a much simpler way, say as a single term that involves factorials, etc. In this book we will show you how several recently developed computer algorithms can do the job for you. If there is a simple form, the algorithms will find it. If there isn’t, they will prove that there isn’t. -pg. 18
